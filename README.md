Climate Change Analysis- Time Series Forecasting in ML
# Objective:

Analyze climate change using temperature data and visualize trends over time.
Data Import and Visualization:

Imported necessary libraries (Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, scikit-learn).
Loaded NASA's climate change dataset for 30 years (1951-1980) and created a scatter plot.
Linear Regression with NumPy:

# Plotted the regression line on the scatter plot.
Computed and displayed the linear equation parameters.
Linear Regression with scikit-learn:

# Utilized scikit-learn's LinearRegression model for the same analysis.
Generated a scatter plot with the regression line.
Displayed the linear equation parameters using scikit-learn.
Seaborn Visualization:

# Used Seaborn to visualize a larger dataset covering years 1882 to 2014.
Plotted scatter points and a regression line for better readability.
Compared actual temperature values with predicted values.
Analysis Insights:

# Scatter Points: Represented yearly temperature differences from a reference point.
Red Line (Regression Line): Indicated the overall trend in temperature changes.
Comparison of Actual vs. Predicted Values: Highlighted the model's accuracy.
Observation of Data: Noted a deviation from predicted values in recent years.
Significance of Deviation: Suggested potential acceleration in climate change.
Implications:

# The analysis provides insights into historical temperature trends.
Deviation in recent years may indicate accelerating climate change.
Understanding these trends is crucial for addressing climate-related challenges.
Conclusion:

The project combines data analysis and visualization to understand climate change trends.
Linear regression models help identify patterns and deviations in temperature data.
Insights from the analysis contribute to ongoing climate change discussions and actions.
